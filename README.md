# University-Projects-2020
They were made to pass my classes of Algorithms and Data Structures using C++ on the platform DevC++.
The codes uses data samples in files *.txt or *.Dat according to the topics learned in class.
The exercises required by the teacher are written in *.pdf files at the beginning. 
Then you would find the data structures, algorithms, code again, and finally the data results
The code contains sorting algorithms, file reading and writing algorithms and methods, dynamic and non-dynamic data structures according to structured programming
